# RGO
A UNIX ransomware made in Go.

It'll AES encrypt every file with a randomly generated 32 bit key and 16 bit IV. The key and IV will be recreated for each file.
This will make files impossible to decrypt.
Basically don't use it for any reasons. If you do nobody will be responsible other than you!
